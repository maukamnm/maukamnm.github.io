                <h2>About me!</h2>
                <p>I am a programmer with experience in web development, Java, and C++ programming on both IOS, and
                    Windows 10.
                    I am a hands on learner with project management experiences, and am a dedicated
                    mother that pushes past the boundaries and stereotypes in the workplace. I first became interested
                    in programming a year and a half ago which was when I fell in love with it. Partly due to fulfilling
                    my passion in helping people with tools and resources in technology, and partly due to my creativity.
                    I started off learning Python, then switched to learning an easier language: HTML. I went on to
                    learn CSS, JavaScript, C++, and then Java. I have dabbled in learning SQL, and various other things
                    like networks,computer information systems, and using Kali and Linux in regards to cyber security.

                        Self-playing Uno game Java application (in-progress): </li>
                    <p> I built a Java self-playing Uno project that contained multiple classes, inheritance, special
                        play logic, polymorphism, and multiple array lists of class objects. I then refactored the
                        project into a Springboot RESTful API. I am currently creating an HTML, JavaScript, and
                        Bootstrap user interface.

                    <p>I am creating a Java console application to allow for the storage of an inheritance base contact
                        class
                        with children classes of personal contact and business contact. Encapsulation of attributes
                        managed business logic and support validation of data. The final project will be deployed on an
                        AWS cloud platform and stored in SQL using JDBC tools. Analyzed program for any bugs using the
                        debugger. Entire project managed as Agile/SCRUM, including user stories, daily stand-ups,
                        burn-down charts, and sprint retrospectives. </p>

                            featured photos, and fonts. Each time, I was approachable and immediately clarified the
